\sloppy
The model contains 318 variables. Some variables are subscripted. There are four subscript ranges with up to four levels:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{zone}: city, ring
            \item \textbf{space use}: motor traffic, car parking, pedestrians, cyclists
            \item \textbf{car adoption status}: young adult, adult car, adult no car
            \item \textbf{user type}: private, sharing
        \end{itemize}The model file and an excel with the sources used for parameter estimation can be found on 
    the \underline{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://github.com/Michared/roadspace-reallocation}{GitHub Repository}}} for this thesis.
