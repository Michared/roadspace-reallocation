This stock and flow represents the length of the road network. The flow "net annual network expansion' is inactive in the current case study, since the length of the road network is stable. It is used for extreme conditions testing and can be applicable when the model is applied to other cities or zones where the road network is being expanded. It can also be used for behavior reproduction testing of historical behavior.

We know there is a cautious majority that will become more receptive to cycling as the cycling network becomes safer and better connected. It is however uncertain how soon that tipping point occurs, and how fast bike use will spread across the fraction of the population receptive to cycling.

Physical time on car trips increases when the network becomes less accessible (network to euclidian distance ratio increases) and when congested speed decreases. Congested spead decreases when peak network density (cars per km of car lane during peak hour) approaches collision density (max cars per km of car lane). The bathtub model of congestion is applied to derive congested speed from these density values. Congested speed takes a range between walking speed (3 km/h and the speed limit in the city (30 km/h).

Subjective travel time by car increases non-linearly with parking search and egress time increasing. The number parking spots in the city per daily car trip is used as a proxy for parking availability.

Public transport subjective travel time increases with overcrowding and with walking attractiveness. Overcrowding increases via an overcrowding multiplier, that goes above 1 when ridership during peak hours goes above the seat capacity, and 2 when seat and standing capacity are both reached (as in Pfaffenbichler (2010)). Walking attractiveness is proxied with available pedestrian space (average sidewalk width).

Mode choice occurs on long distances between public transport and cars, and on mid distances between public transport and bikes. All short distance trips are assumed to be done by foot, meaning no choice model is applied to the short trip distance band. The applied model is entropy maximization, where the beta parameter determines the degree of dispersion of mode choice (i.e. how strongly mode choice varies due to gaps in subjective travel time). Access to transport modes precedes mode choice and determines the size of population groups considering each set of options.

Shift in destination choice is an uncertainty related to future policy.|<<NnN>>|- We know that destination choice will change due to increasing attractiveness of active modes. Increasing attractiveness of cycling and walking will cause a shift from mid - long distance trips towards short - mid distance trips. |<<NnN>>|- We also know that mixed land use plans will increase proximity of destinations overall, and the construction of a tangential public transport line will increase the self-contention of the first ring, leading to less long distance trips from the ring to the city. |<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|The effect of land use policy falls outside the mode scope, and the model is not disaggregate enough to endogenize destination choice in a valid manner. Therefore, shifting destination choice is treated as an exogenous uncertainty. We do assume proximity and self-containment will increase, but vary the rate at which this occurs.
